- 👋 Hi, I’m @jawswithacause
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python, Javascript and React.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python on freecodecamp.org.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner Python projects, as well as some front end web site development that can make use of my skills with HTML and CSS.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: jaworskitechacct@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my self-taught education the first week of July, 2024. I'm excited to gain knowledge and skills that will help me create my own projects so I can add them to my repository here, and hopefully catch the eyes of some potential employers!
